# How to setup the Geeetech MeCreator 2 in Cura
This guide will show you how to setup your Geeetech MeCreator 2 in Cura. I made it because I couldn't find one myself when I got my MeCreator2 and had to ask in the community. The people there are really helpful and you can also ask the people from Geeetech for assistance, if needed.

## Setting up the MC2 as a new printer in Cura
1. Open Cura (Version 3+)
2. Click "Settings" -> "Printer" -> "New Printer"
3. A window will open, showing you a list of printers to choose from. In the "Custom"-Tab select "Custom FDM printer".
4. Then at the bottom left corner change the name to "MeCreator2" (or anything you desire), then click "Add printer".
5. A window will open. Fill out the form fields according to the following image:
